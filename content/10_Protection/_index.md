## About the Workload Security components

Workload Security consists of the following set of components that work together to provide protection:

- <b>Workload Security console</b>:  the centralized web-based management console that administrators use to configure security policy and deploy protection to the enforcement components, the Deep Security Agent.

- <b>Deep Security Agent</b>: is a security agent deployed directly on a computer which provides Application Control, Anti-Malware, Web Reputation service, Firewall, Intrusion Prevention, Integrity Monitoring, and Log Inspection protection to computers on which it is installed.

- The Deep Security Agent contains a <b>Relay</b>: module. A relay-enabled agent distributes software and security updates throughout your network of Deep Security components.

- <b>Deep Security Notifier</b>:  is a Windows System Tray application that communicates information on the local computer about security status and events, and, in the case of relay-enabled agents, also provides information about the security updates being distributed from the local machine.
