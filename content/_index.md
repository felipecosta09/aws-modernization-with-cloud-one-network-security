In this workshop, you’ll learn how to leverage edge protection deployment with Cloud One - Network Security to provide a powerful network security layer which can be deployed seamlessly into your existing AWS architecture, making it easier and simpler to apply cloud security. This technology inspects inbound and outbound traffic, detecting and preventing malicious payloads and attacks against your application running in AWS, and enabling organizations to securely achieve their business goals.

Using **Trend Micro - Cloud One, AWS Internet Gateway, AWS NAT Gateway, AWS CloudWatch**, and other AWS services, you’ll get hands-on experience implementing Network Security via CloudFormation to automate deployment, security and compliance workflows.
